# 👋 Hi 
I’m Edric—a **Data Scientist and Technical Writer** with a passion for making complex AI and machine learning concepts easy to understand and apply.

I simplify AI/ML through code and writing, making cutting-edge technology accessible to all. When I’m not coding, I’m working on clear, beginner-friendly content.

My work sits at the intersection of AI/ML, technical writing, and continuous learning, always striving to make tech more approachable.
